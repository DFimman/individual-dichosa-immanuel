        /*
    Takeaway: Compile-Time vs Runtime Polymorphism

    Compile-Time (Method Overloading)
    - Same method name, different parameters (type, number, or order)
    - The complier chooses which method to call, before the program runs.
    - The choice is based on the argument you pass.
    - If the compiler cannot find a match, or cannot pick just one, you get a compile error.

    Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
    - Same method name and same parameters, in a parenet and child class.
    - The JVM chooses which method to run, while the program is running.
    - The choice is based the actual object, not the variable type.
    - The compiler only checks that the variable type (Animal) has the method
